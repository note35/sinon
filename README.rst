# Sinon.py

Standalone and test framework agnostic Python test spies, stubs and mocks (pronounced "sigh-non").

## Special Thanks 

This idea is inspired by [sinonjs](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon)
All the content is copied the idea but rewriting in python.

## Progress

This project is still under developing.

The first release will include four basic features. The second release have not planned yet.

Because the concept of closure in JS and Python are different, I plan to skip all closure related functions.

spy[80%] - excluding "JS-closure related function"

stub[50%] - excluding "JS-closure related test"

mock[99%]

sandbox[20%] - may ignore sandbox feature, only keep decorator

## Installation

pass
